# cx_Oracle
cs_Oracle Automation

This is a simple example of how cs_Oracle can be used to build dyanmic SQL Query
and iterate over a list of parameters.

For this project I had a file of accounts that needed to be inspected.
By pulling data from sql and opening their Sales Force Accounts.
With this query I was able to iterate over the list without having to manual write the query and open the websites
